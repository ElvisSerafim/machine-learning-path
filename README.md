In this repository are some courses and path to learn Machine Learning in 3 - 4 months. I hope I can help people who are just starting out. 

## Project Status: ![Active]

## Month 1

This month we gonna divider in to four weeks planning for study.

  

### Week 1:
Probability:

*  [Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data](https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data)
> Introduction to probabilistic models, including random processes and the basic elements of statistical inference.

### Week 2:
Linear Algebra:

* [Linear Algebra]([https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/))
>This is a basic subject on matrix theory and linear algebra. Emphasis is given to topics that will be useful in other disciplines, including systems of equations, vector spaces, determinants, eigenvalues, similarity, and positive definite matrices. 

### Week 3:
Calculous:

* [Calculous - Essences of calculous]([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr))
> This youtube channel have so many videos with so much theory of calculous.

### Week 4:
Algorithms:

* [# Algorithm Design and Analysis]([https://www.edx.org/course/algorithm-design-and-analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/algorithm-design-and-analysis))
>Learn about the core principles of computer science: algorithmic thinking and computational problem solving.
